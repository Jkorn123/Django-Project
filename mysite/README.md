This website creates a stock list and tracks the user's stock holding which only
includes the number of shares. Unfortunately, I was unable to use the yfinance api
as I wanted to in the beginning because some things happened. However, an extra
feature I decided to include was a registration form where the user would be able
to sign up if they already did not have an account. This website allows the user
to enter certain data and it will save under the user's account. The most recent
commit is final.
